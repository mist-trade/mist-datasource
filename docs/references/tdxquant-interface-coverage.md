# TdxQuant Interface Coverage Matrix

Reviewed on 2026-06-27 from the official TdxQuant documentation.

This matrix defines how `mist-datasource` should cover TDX APIs while keeping
NestJS on provider-neutral `/v1` datasource contracts. The target is broad
coverage for non-trading data APIs. Trading/account execution APIs are outside
the market datasource boundary.

## Classifications

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `normalized-now` | Implement or keep as a stable provider-neutral `/v1` data endpoint in the current/near phase. |
| `normalized-phase-2` | Implement after core market, calendar, sector, and security metadata endpoints. |
| `normalized-phase-3` | Implement after reference/instrument endpoints; mainly finance/report data. |
| `normalized-phase-4` | Implement formula data/execution with limits, timeout handling, and explicit errors. |
| `internal-only` | Used by Python runtime internals; exposed to NestJS only through normalized protocol. |
| `admin-only` | Potential operator/admin workflow, not ordinary market data reads. |
| `raw-only` | Diagnostic escape hatch through `/v1/raw/tdx/call`; not a stable application dependency. |
| `example-helper-not-api` | Found in examples but not verified as a native `tq.*` method. |
| `do-not-expose` | Outside datasource boundary. Requires a separate service/design if ever needed. |

## Admin/Operator Or Raw-Only Utilities

`/v1/raw/tdx/call` is a datasource operator/debug escape hatch for smoke tests,
official-doc exploration, and incident diagnostics. It is not a stable backend
dependency, and normal Mist collection code must use normalized `/v1` endpoints
or WebSocket commands instead.
